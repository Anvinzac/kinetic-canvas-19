/**
 * Render one word to an MP4, headlessly, with no browser automation dependency.
 *
 * Two modes, because they capture different things:
 *
 *   feed    (default) the real /feed page as a visitor sees it — toolbar, action bar,
 *           progress, all of it — at a phone-sized viewport, for one whole word. This is
 *           what a promo clip wants: the app, not a cutout of it.
 *   export  the stripped /export/$code frame, chrome removed to the preset's clear zone.
 *           Addressable by share code, for when one specific word is wanted.
 *
 * Everything after this — uploading to a Page, pushing a TikTok draft, scheduling — is
 * routine once a good file exists.
 *
 * It drives the installed Chrome over the DevTools protocol and captures with
 * Page.startScreencast, rather than the screen-capture path Export Studio uses. That
 * matters: getDisplayMedia wants a permission prompt and a visible tab, which is exactly
 * what an unattended job cannot give it. Screencast asks the browser for the frames it is
 * already compositing, so there is nothing to approve.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: Node's own WebSocket talks CDP, and ffmpeg (already on
 * this machine) assembles the frames. Nothing is added to the app's tree for a tool that
 * belongs in the poster repo eventually.
 *
 * It records in REAL TIME, like Export Studio: a 30-second word takes 30 seconds. Frames
 * arrive irregularly, so each one's own timestamp drives its duration in the concat list
 * and ffmpeg resamples to a constant rate — otherwise the clip drifts out of time with
 * the animation it is supposed to be showing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/render-export-clip.ts                  # one word off the live feed
 *   npx tsx scripts/render-export-clip.ts --mode export T22
 *
 *     --mode <feed|export>  what to record (default: feed)
 *     --base <url>          app origin (default: http://localhost:5195)
 *     --out <path>          output file
 *     --fps <n>             output frame rate (default: 30)
 *     --max <seconds>       give up if the word never finishes (default: 120)
 *   feed mode:
 *     --css <w>x<h>         CSS viewport, phone-sized (default: 405x720)
 *     --side <px>           left/right inset clear of a platform's crop (default: 25)
 *     --controls <keep|hide>  the top transport controls (default: keep)
 *     --intro <on|off>      the opening badge (default: on)
 *     --badge <text>        what the badge says (default: "Từ gì mà ...")
 *     --outro <on|off>      the anh.chayla.app end card (default: on)
 *     --preset <id>         whose safe area the title corner follows (default: tiktok-clear)
 *     --scale <n>           device pixel ratio (default: 2.667 — 405×720 → 1080×1920)
 *   export mode:
 *     --preset <id>         export preset (default: tiktok-clear)
