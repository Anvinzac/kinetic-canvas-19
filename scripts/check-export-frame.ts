/**
 * Guard: the export route's contract, which something outside this repo depends on.
 *
 * /export/$code exists so a scheduled job can record one word without driving Export
 * Studio's UI. That makes its surface published: the phase names, the stage attribute and
 * the start event are what a recorder waits on, and renaming one breaks a job that nobody
 * is watching, at whatever hour it runs.
 *
 * This asserts the contract's shape and that every word is addressable. Whether the page
 * actually reaches `done` is a browser question, checked by driving it (see the route's
 * own doc comment) rather than here.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/check-export-frame.ts
