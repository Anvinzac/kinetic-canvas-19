/**
 * Assert every app tile points somewhere the app actually answers.
 *
 * The drawer's tiles are full navigations to sibling hosts, and the only thing deciding
 * what a host serves is `SUBDOMAINS` in target-language.ts. A tile whose label has drifted
 * from that map still renders, still looks right, and quietly lands the reader on a deck in
 * the wrong language — or on the English fallback, which is what an unknown subdomain
 * resolves to. Nothing about that is visible from the drawer.
 *
 * It also pins the filter the drawer relies on: each record carries the locale its host
 * serves, and the drawer hides the tile matching the page already open. If a record's
 * `locale` disagrees with what `resolveTarget` says its own URL resolves to, the drawer
 * either hides the wrong tile or offers the reader the page they are standing on.
 *
 * Usage: npm run check:ecosystem-apps
