/**
 * The word joiner: how deck text says "these syllables are ONE word".
 *
 * Vietnamese is written syllable by syllable with a space between each, so "ba lô"
 * (a backpack) looks the same as two unrelated words and a line may break in the middle
 * of it. Deck text therefore joins the syllables of a single word with an underscore —
 * `ba_lô`, `quan_trọng` — the convention Vietnamese word segmenters already use, visible
 * to a reviewer and easy for a generator to write. Words stay separated by spaces.
 *
 * The underscore never reaches a reader. When a catalog is loaded it is turned into the
 * two characters Unicode provides for exactly this: a NO-BREAK SPACE between spaced
 * syllables and a WORD JOINER between glyphs of an unspaced script. Prose then keeps the
 * word on one line with no code at all — a browser will not break at either — and the
 * kinetic stages read the same characters back as phrases that must stay whole.
 *
 * Exports: WORD_JOINER_MARK, CLITIC_BIND_MARK, PHRASE_BREAK_MARK, encodeWordJoiners,
 *          stripWordJoiners, splitWordJoiners, splitPhrases, countJoinedUnits,
 *          withWordJoiners
 * Depends on: ./schema (types only)
