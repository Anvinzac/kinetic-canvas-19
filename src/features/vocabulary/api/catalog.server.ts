 * accepted against the revision that issued it, so if the pool could change while the
 * revision stayed still, a reader would page on through a deck that is no longer the one
 * their cursor was cut from — positions would quietly point at different words. Folding the
 * digest in turns that into an honest 409 and a fresh stream.
 *
 * With nothing blocked the digest is empty and the catalog is returned untouched, so the
 * ordinary case allocates nothing and the revision is exactly the deck's own.
