/**
 * Virtualize a bounded page window without accumulating huge spacers.
 *
 * The window is anchored on the OCCURRENCE that is on screen, never on arithmetic over
 * server positions. The list it is given is filtered (words the history blocks are
 * removed), so positions have gaps: translating "position 40" into a row by subtracting
 * the first row's position lands on the wrong word as soon as one row before it is
 * missing. Every time the list changes — a page arrives, an old one is evicted, a blocked
 * word unlocks — the anchor is looked up again by id and the scroll offset is moved by
 * exactly the number of rows it shifted.
 *
 * It is also the only thing that writes the scroll offset. Every write goes straight to
 * the element; the virtualizer's own scrollToIndex is not used, because it keeps
 * re-asserting "row N" for seconds afterwards, and row N stops meaning the same word the
 * moment the list changes underneath it.
 *
 * @param entries Occurrences to show, in order (gaps in `position` are expected).
 * @param overscan How many words either side of the visible one to keep mounted.
 *   Normally 2, so a flick lands on an already-rendered card; 0 while an overlay
 *   covers the feed, where the neighbours cannot be seen and only cost memory.
 * @returns Viewport bindings.
