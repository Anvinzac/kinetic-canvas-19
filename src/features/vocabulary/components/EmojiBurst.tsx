/**
 * Reveal-page celebration layer: a word's emoji aggregate billows out as two-sided
 * smoke, gradually, across the reveal page AND the spelling coda, and the whole
 * layer fades out as the word leaves.
 *
 * Each emoji flies out of its OWN button in the emoji strip (that button carries
 * the count as a badge), and the number of glyphs that fly for an emoji is
 * apportioned from the same count, so the flight and the numbers agree.
 *
 * Purely presentational by design — it arms no timer and calls no completion
 * handler, because page timing belongs solely to useLearningPlayback. It also
 * takes no pointer events, so the card's tap/swipe gestures and the emoji strip
 * underneath keep working while glyphs are in flight.
 *
 * Exports: EmojiBurst
 * Depends on: framer-motion, ../lib/emoji
