/**
 * One word, rendered as a finished promo clip and nothing else.
 *
 * The whole sequence — opening badge, the word in the app's own chrome, end card — as a
 * state machine in one component, instead of a recorder reaching into the live feed and
 * operating it from outside.
 *
 * That outside approach is what this replaces, and it is worth saying why it failed, since
 * it looked like it worked for a while. To hold the first clue back, the recorder clicked
 * the feed's pause button — and lost the race: the entrance had already played within a
 * second of the card mounting, so the clip opened on finished text. To get a fresh
 * entrance it then synthesised taps on the card's own tap zones to navigate forward and
 * back, which turned out to move TWO pages per touch (the card answers both pointerup and
 * touchend), so the page indicator visibly flicked to a later clue and back. Here the same
 * thing is a prop: the card is handed `active={false}` until the badge has gone, so its
 * first page has not started rather than being rewound.
 *
 * The CONTRACT is the point of the file — see SHOWCASE_CONTRACT. Treat it as published:
 * changing a phase name breaks whatever is recording, and scripts/check-showcase.ts is
 * what says so.
 *
 * Exports: ShowcasePage
 * Depends on: VocabularyCard, showcase-contract, saved-words (catalog), vocabulary.css
