/**
 * The feed's top bar, drawn as scenery for a clip.
 *
 * Not the real toolbar. That one carries a difficulty dropdown, a settings sheet, an
 * ecosystem menu and the focus handling they need — all of it for a reader who can tap,
 * and none of which a video has any use for. Rendering it here would mean mounting that
 * machinery, then suppressing it, and keeping the suppression working.
 *
 * So this draws what the bar LOOKS like and nothing it does: the wordmark, the difficulty
 * line, and the transport icons held back at the opacity the recorded frame wants, as
 * inert glyphs. Everything is `pointer-events: none` by virtue of having no handlers at
 * all, which is the strongest form of "not interactive" available.
 *
 * Exports: ShowcaseChrome
 * Depends on: vocabulary.css (.vocab-toolbar and friends)
