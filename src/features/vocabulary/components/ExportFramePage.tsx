/**
 * One word, rendered for a recorder and nothing else.
 *
 * Export Studio is an overlay inside the feed: to reach it something has to load /feed,
 * find the right word, open a panel and press buttons. That is a fine thing for a person
 * and a bad thing for a daily job, which would be driving UI internals and would break
 * silently the next time the panel changed.
 *
 * This page is the stable surface instead: one URL per word, nothing on screen but the
 * card at the preset's exact aspect, and a small contract a recorder can wait on. The
 * CONTRACT is the point of the file — see EXPORT_CONTRACT below. Treat it as published:
 * changing an attribute or a phase name breaks whatever is recording, and
 * scripts/check-export-frame.ts is what says so.
 *
 * It renders the same VocabularyCard with the same exportLayout Export Studio uses, so
 * what a job captures here is what a reader sees there.
 *
 * Exports: ExportFramePage
 * Depends on: VocabularyCard, export presets, saved-words (share-code lookup), vocabulary.css
