/**
 * Harmonized palette collection.
 *
 * A palette binds five interdependent roles — a two-color backdrop, ink (body text),
 * two highlight accents, and the text color that sits on an accent fill — instead of
 * letting each be chosen independently. Every entry is checked against WCAG
 * contrast floors and separation floors, and `ensureReadablePalette` repairs a
 * stored palette that an operator hand-edited into an unreadable state, so a
 * conflicting combination can never reach the screen.
 *
 * The backdrop is deliberately two colors, not one shade: the second stop gives the
 * card depth and gives the per-page transition sweep somewhere visible to travel.
 *
 * Exports: Palette types, PALETTE_SCHEMES, PALETTE_THRESHOLDS, generatePalette,
 *          auditPalette, ensureReadablePalette, paletteSwatches, rgbToHex, hslHex,
 *          paletteBackgroundStops, paletteBackdropColors, VIETNAMESE_SAFE_FONTS,
 *          DEFAULT_PALETTE_FONT, isVietnameseCapableFont
 * Depends on: ./contrast/color-math
 *
 * This module is intentionally free of data imports so `scripts/check-palette-contrast.ts`
 * can run it under bare Node type-stripping. That is also why the color-math
 * specifier carries an explicit `.ts` extension: Node ESM will not resolve an
 * extensionless relative import, and color-math is itself a leaf module. The
 * seeded collection lives in ./palette-collection.
