/**
 * Browser-only gate for the endpoints that hand out word content.
 *
 * The feed and the single-word lookup are called by the app's own pages with `fetch`, so a
 * legitimate request always looks like one: a browser user agent, the Fetch Metadata
 * headers every current browser attaches (`Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` for a call from
 * our own page), and an Accept-Language. Command-line clients, scraping libraries and
 * declared crawlers send none of that by default, and a URL pasted into the address bar
 * arrives as a navigation, not a same-origin fetch.
 *
 * What this is and is not: every header here can be forged by someone who sets out to,
 * so it is a filter for tools and crawlers run as-is, not a lock. The rate limits and the
 * signed stream cursor are what bound a client that does forge them.
 *
 * Local hosts are exempt, so the dev server and the clip recorder (headless Chrome against
 * localhost by default) keep working.
 *
 * Exports: WORD_DATA_PATHS, isBrowserRequest, browserOnlyResponse
 * Depends on: none (leaf module)
