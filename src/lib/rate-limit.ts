/**
 * One sliding-window rate limiter for every public endpoint.
 *
 * This is the limiter that used to live inside word-report.server.ts, lifted out unchanged
 * so the other public routes can share it. It was written there, applied there, and four
 * sibling endpoints never got one — including the unauthenticated telemetry POST, which
 * writes through the service-role key. A limit that has to be remembered per endpoint is a
 * limit the next endpoint will not have.
 *
 * Privacy: the caller's address is ONLY ever a key in the in-memory map below. It is never
 * stored, never logged, and never leaves this module. (Where a caller has to be counted
 * across requests for longer than a window — the word-block rule — that uses a salted
 * digest instead; see reporter-digest.server.ts.)
 *
 * Limits of the approach, stated because they decide what this is good for: the window
 * lives in one process's memory, so with more than one instance the real budget is
 * `limit × instances`, and a cold start forgets everything. That is fine for holding off
 * casual abuse and accidental retry storms, which is what these endpoints need. It is NOT
 * a budget you can prove, so anything that must hold exactly — a spend cap, a quota —
 * belongs in Postgres where every instance can see the same counter.
 *
 * Exports: RATE_LIMITS, NEW_STREAM_BUDGET, callerKey, checkRateLimit, rateLimitedResponse,
 *   resetRateLimits
 * Depends on: none (leaf module)
